We used eclipse to do this assignment

How to Runt he code
Either import this java file in eclispe or any other java tool like Netbeans.
Or it can also run on any online Java compiler

It has no external files.

Note: Executeable file is created but it was giving warning about compilation. I uploaded the jar file as well, If it doesnt work it doesnt mean there is error in code.
Since It was my first time to create executeable file of commandline output java file.
